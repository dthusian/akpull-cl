Most gacha simulators estimate your chances of success by running millions of simulations of possible scenarios. This one is no different.
The difference with this one is that it uses OpenCL to up the millions of simulations into the billions. The simulation engine is
somewhat configurable and while it is designed for Arknights, it should not be hard to adapt to other games.
